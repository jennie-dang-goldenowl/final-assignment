So much easier than hand writing 100+ addresses out every year.  I also print out on plain paper this list to keep track of who I receive cards from, who has moved, divorced, or passed away. Correction are then made to the master file for the next season.",5,,1,299

5,"Our town's energy committee recently had a project for which we needed about 250 peel-off labels.  Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use.  CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs.  For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000.  There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004Z5SN Avery Address Labels]] were a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name.  The question was how to get the information printed on the labels.  At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes.  I downloaded the software easily and got started on the design<br /><br />For laser printer labels, there were fourteen pre-made templates for the different size labels.  I chose the template that matched my labels.  Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint.  I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text.  A test run on my color laser printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels.  The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up.  I can never remember.  After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.<br /><br />Our community day give-away was a big success.  Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours.  We had enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs.  One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways.  The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.  I am now a big fan of Avery labels, but I recommend getting the free software to make them work.getting the free software to make them work.",5,,1,315
6,"These Avery address labels are the greatest. I remember all of the secretaries using them at work to address letters and label files and such. I am now blind, and although I can write well, it gets tiring to write for a long time or to do some more tedious writing, like labels. So, when I got ready to send out my Christmas cards this year, I ordered this box of address labels, not that I send that many cards out, but they will still be handy to have for the occasional label or  two. After ordering them, the first thing I did was to go to Avery.com, and download a free template for these labels for use with Microsoft Word. The template makes the job as painless as it can get. As this template will work for several of the Avery products, when first opened, it will say something like, there are 10 columns and 10 rows. You can just delete the columns or rows that you do not need, and then save the template, and you will have just what you need. These particular labels come on a page of 10 rows by 3 columns wide, for a total of 30 labels per sheet. As you arrow down the empty page, you will see the cursor moving from row 1 to row 2, and so forth. When you are on the label that you want, usualally row 1, column 1, you simply type in your address in the normal way. Avery also has a load of free clip art that you can download to personalize your labels, and I put a Christmas motif on mine. It actually made addressing envelopes enjoyable for a change, and with the peel and stick feature, no pastey tongue.",5,,1,9

11,"I've been using Avery labels for my label needs for many years.  The best thing about Avery labels that they stick on very well, smoothly, without puckers. I use the lables also with the colored ink jet printer and black and white laser printer. The paper quality is good and there is no blurring of ink when used with ink jet printers. Laser printer results are excellent as well.<br /><br />I usually do need to print a huge number of labels and can't fill the entire sheet. However I found that I can reliably print the labels on the sheet in two several passes, even when some labels were alredy peeled off. o avoid labels sicking to the printer I flip the sheet and have the part that has no peeled labels go first. This really helps me to save money and only print what I need without waste.<br /><br />Avery redesigned the label sheet to reduce wasted paper. Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels.  Despite less of a hold on the labels I am still able to feed the paper through twice as described above.<br /><br />There is a large variety of free templates for use with Avery labels, all you need to know is the number of the label to get the right template.  Using templates I get perfect results with several different word processors - no waste, all labels get printered and perfectly aligned.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Avery labels.<br /><br />Ali Julia review",5,,1,323

15,"Special events, or meetings enjoy an added touch of elegance with these short, and wide tent cards, with a subtle, attractive embossed border.<br /><br />These thick cards look fantastic, and are suitable for either inkjet, or laser printers.<br /><br />The separation is sharp, and easy considering these cards utilize the entire width of the page, and only need to be detached at top and bottom.",5,,2,322
16,"These medium size tent cards are great for displaying your name in a professional setting.  I have used these a few times for meetings in our office where we have guest speakers and just have our agents names printed on them.  it works very well.  You can go to Avery's website and design your card the way you want, but I just did the bare minimum with people's names on them.<br /><br />If you do trade shows, or cook outs, these would also be great for labeling stuff on the counter.  They were easy to use and gave me no trouble.",4,,2,262
17,"I love how easy Avery has made it for people to have professional looking products, even folks like me, that don't really have much computer knowledge.<br /><br />These cards will have to be torn off and folded, but there's tear lines and creases to make it easier. The large tent cards have 2 per page, and the small ones have 4 per page.<br /><br />To design these cards, Avery has made it super easy, so you don't have to know your way around a computer too much. You can just go to the provided website, and type in the product code(on the front of the package). From there, you can pick from many different designs, and customize your cards. You can make it as cute or as business-y as you'd like. It will automatically print the way it's supposed to if using their site. (I wouldn't know where to begin in order to print them correctly, otherwise.)<br /><br />These are perfect if you want professional looking tent cards for any kind of event or celebration, but have a limited budget and don't know your way around a computer very well.",4,,2,261
18,These tent cards are great. You can set out in front for all you clients to see. The stand up great. Can also be used as place cards as well. Great paper for printing. The design comes out bold and bright. While the lettering comes out sharp. Overall a great quality product,5,,2,115
19,"These cards are handy & attractive heavy paper for DIY table tents. I like the embossed border, and they produce a clean, crisp print. They're convenient and give a clean, unified, professional appearance to whatever your application (panel tables, shop shelves, buffet table). They also coordinate with other sizes of the same product, if you have call for different sizes. They come 2-up, widthwise, on a letter size page and tear cleanly with microperforation.<br /><br />I would describe them as heavyweight paper, or lightweight cardstock. The weight is less flimsy in the medium tents than the large ones.<br /><br />Since the focus here is more on easy customization than a durable product, so I don't think the material is inappropriate to its use. But do understand that these are throwaways; you won't be reusing them for multiple events unless you're the typle to successfully reuse wrapping paper. But they are attractive, and they'll still do nicely for short-term shop signage, as long as they're not by a door (breezes).",4,,2,349
20,Perfect to use for any party or business meeting; I use these in the classroom to do the assigned seats. They are thick cardstock and last for about two weeks f continuous use.,5,,2,256
21,Compatible with inkjet and laser printers. I use the 5309 card stock when I am bringing a dish to a buffet or potluck because the large space allows for the inclusion of ingredients that everyone likes to have.<br /><br />The 5305 is ideal for smaller needs like table setting or name plates in in small venues. I even use them at our annual garage sale to indicate a $1 table or under $5 table.<br /><br />If you don't want the name AVERY embossed on your cards you will need to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Even at list price it is only 25 cents per card.,5,,2,142
22,"These tent cards come two to a sheet and run the whole width of the page, which is a handy size.<br /><br />They are a pure white on medium-weight stock.  The paper takes ink well and is compatible with inkjet or laser printers.  The cards separate easily.<br /><br />There are templates and designs available that work for PC or Mac.",5,,2,197
23,"These are very nice tent cards that are perfect for large events, particularly when you want to be able to see a person's name or company from afar. Each sheet produces two tents, with just a tiny strip of paper at the top and bottom that needs to be torn away. The &#34;embossing&#34; on the card is a simple rectangle that gives the tent a nice finished look.<br /><br />I've found that the first few times I use them, the Avery templates require a little bit of a learning curve on my part, but they are simple to use once I put some practice in. For these particular tents, because they are so basic (and because there are only two per sheet), they were quite simple. And there were a lot of options to choose from on the Avery website.",5,,2,209
24,"There are two tent cards per sheet, and they are slightly embossed - there is a line all around each side of the card at about half an inch from all edges.<br />I liked that it can be used with both laser and inkjet printers. I used laser printer, and the cards came out well. They are easy to separate - you need to fold them back and forth to do it, and they leave slightly bumpy edge because of the tiny perforations. Folding the cards was a little harder because some of the cards wanted t fold on the embossing lines as opposed to the folding line, so I had to be careful about that, but they turned out to look OK. I liked that their online template shows you the right way of how the card will look placed on the desk, not upside down",4,,2,216
25,"Very similar to the Avery White Laser & Ink Jet 3 1/2 x 11 Inch Tent Cards, the Avery White Laser & Ink Jet 2 1/2 x 8 1/2 Inch Tent Cards are just a bit small and cannot hold as much information as the larger ones, but still are impressive and large enough to be noticed on a table or display. Like all the Avery products I've used, these cards live up to the standards I have set for Avery. They are a nice size, made of heavy-weight card stock, have an embossed framing and are easy to print and tear apart. These cards are a nice size and would work well for name plates, titles with descriptions, logs with business names, buffet cards listing name and ingredients, etc.<br /><br />To print, one can either use the software of can go to Avery's website and use the online designer (which is my preference). There are so many designs to choose from and you end up with a nice professional look in very little time. One suggestion is to print a test print on plain paper/card stock before committing to the cards since each printer prints a bit differently.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the Avery White Laser & Ink Jet 2 1/2 x 8 1/2 Inch Tent Cards and would recommend them for business, clubs as well as personal use.",5,,2,356
26,We've been impressed with these Avery tent cards.  They print well using Avery's program and our Oki LED printer.  My wife has been using them at sales and is having good success getting the results she wants.,5,,2,201
27,"These are the perfect weight for tent cards, heavy enough not to get knocked over by the casual breeze or person walking by.  I am not able to find the weight of the paper itself, as I haven’t been able to for any of the Avery cards.  I always check this for cardstock so I would have assumed it would be easier to find.<br /><br />One thing that bothers me is the edges on these pages.  The cards do not go to the edge of the page.  Is that because of some standardized tent card size that I don’t know about?  It says to bend the scored parts back and forth until it comes apart easily but I still had edges that were rough.  Why don’t the cards just go to the end of the page?  That way the pages still go through the printer without messing with the tray, but doesn't have to be bent all the extra times.<br /><br />It says ~Embossed~ under the Medium and Tent Cards.  That means the name Avery is embossed with its logo.",3,,2,273
28,Unlike most name card tents this one has two name cards per page.<br />The smaller size is just as effective as the larger sizes.  The smaller size offers a readable name card with a smaller footprint.<br /><br />Like all Avery products has good quality card stock.<br />Holds both printer ink and ink from pens well.,5,,2,240
29,"These Avery Tent cards are great for advertising items on display. I used mine with a laser printer and they looked great. They also work with ink jet printers. The printing was really clear. Avery has templates, but my design was very simple and a template wasn't necessary. My printer was able to pick up the sheets easily and run them through from the tray. The perforation separates well and then a simple fold makes it into a tent. The paper isn't really thick and may move around with a bit of a breeze, but the cards are great for one or two uses. They hold up well and were ideal for my project.",4,,2,156
30,"Originally I thought of Avery as a label company, but over the past five or so years they've come out with a range of products geared towards branding and marketing.  I've tried quite a few and have always been impressed with the quality and these were no exception.  I thought the paper quality was high and it was easy to use the perforations to separate them without ripping or jagged edges.<br /><br />There are also tons of designs available - 432 - to be used with this product in Avery's online design and print too.  Some of the Avery products I've gotten haven't had many available designs, so I really appreciated the range to choose from.  That said, many of the designs looked a bit outdated or cheesy for my tastes.  They don't seem to be on par with the templates I've seen offered on Etsy or for free on blogs.  If you have a certain aesthetic in mind you may want to peek at Avery's library before purchasing to see if you find something you like.  Once you do find a style I do think Avery makes it intuitive to personalize your design, which I appreciate, and I like that you can design and print online so no software is necessary.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite impressed with these.  I think that the quality of the paper good and I like that there are a ton of designs available, though I wish that overall the designs were of higher quality",4,,2,132
31,"These cards are simple, but they definitely are better than merely printing on a piece of paper and folding it. I imagine it would be best for a meeting where everybody doesn't know each other. However, I am using them to be placed out in front of papers on a table in order to identify what is on the table and to direct people as to which papers to grab. For this purpose, printing is basically just as fast as printing onto a standard piece of paper and folding it, but the result is much more professional looking. With the templates from Avery.com designing and printing takes seconds.",5,,2,223

33,"I really liked these tent cards, they were easy to design and print with Avery's online designer software and the size is perfect for my needs, not so small that you can't read them, but not large enough that they stick out. Could be easier to separate and a bit pricey for how many you get but if you just need them for a special event they are worth getting.",4,,2,378
34,"If you have an event where you need place cards for guests, such as a wedding or convention, you might find the Avery Laser & Ink Jet 2 12 x 8 12 Inch White Tent Cards 100 Count (5305) useful. These tent cards can be printed to any inkjet or laser printer, and look great.<br /><br />The package has 50 sheets that each have 2 tent cards on them, for a total of 100 tent cards. Avery includes instructions in the package that provide a web address where you can download the Avery design software or use their online design tool. I installed the software on two different Windows 7 x64 computers, and the software didn’t work on either of them. When I try to launch the software, it presents a blank window with no options. The online design tool works much better and has a lot of options to choose from, including different designs, backgrounds, etc. You can save your project to your computer so that you can print it later without having to design it again.<br /><br />These tent cards are easy to use and look great. I would recommend them.",5,,2,274

The final results look great, which is the most important thing.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",5,,2,307

They are just right for a booth at that convention.<br /><br />Imagine a letter size paper.  Fold it in half and tear.  Fold that in half lengthwise.  That's the size of the tent card, too large for place seating at a wedding but good for a display table.<br /><br />You could make your own tent cards out of cardstock, but these tent cards are embossed so that the outer edge looks like a frame.  That subtle touch makes a difference.  The cards are also lightly scored, to make folding sharper and cleaner.  I like it.",5,,2,219

It literally takes a few minutes to pick and create a personalized design from the 423 designs available on the Avery Web site. These can be used both in a laser and inkjet printer. I created a sample design and printed it both in a laser and inkjet printer and both looked fine. The word Avery is embossed ont he botton left of each card.   The card stock and embossing looks great for something that can be made on a home or office computer.

This one is definitely better.  It feels sturdier, like it'll tear less easily and it's not as thin.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars was because it's not as thick and nice as some brands, but it's decent for the price.

I am always carrying green tote bags to the grocery store.<br /><br />  The college ruled paper is perfect for my tiny, illegible scribbling.  I am able to write on both sides of the sheet if I write in pencil.  If I use an ink pen, I can only write on the front.  The pink left-hand margin and the blue lines are easy for me to see.

76,"As many are noting, this is thin paper.  A marker will bleed through so that you can use only one side, but a standard ink pen won't unless you're one who really bears down when writing.  Other than that, this is adequate for high school students, but nothing outstanding.",3,,4,247
77,"I am getting really frustrated that so many companies now offer a cheapie version of a product and then nicer more serviceable versions. The cheap version can be simple and no frills but it is ridiculous to make the cheap version useless.<br /><br />This paper is so thin you can see the writing on the following page (not just the other side) through it. The gentlest of marks scars the paper as if you dug the pen in. The paper has no tooth at all. It is as slick as writing on wrapping paper. Not only is it not pleasant to write on, it doesn't facilitate good penmanship. The holes are punched haphazardly. There were hanging tabs that didn't punch all the way out. There were ridges where the punching was uneven around the hole so that the paper sticks on the three ring binder.<br /><br />Lastly if you are a lefty this is just plain useless.",1,,4,61
78,"This is fairly standard as notebook paper goes. The quality isn't amazing, but it's also not rubbish. It's roughly equivalent to what I'm used to finding in most college-ruled notebooks I encounter. The size is a bit under standard letter size. That can be inconvenient if you're expecting letter-sized paper, obviously. If you're buying paper for a course that uses one of those tiny little desks at some schools that give you almost no room to work, though, a little undersized is probably just right.",4,,4,302
79,"I thought, at first, that this was pretty unremarkable filler paper; it looks pretty typical. Sure, it's on the cheaper end of quality, but notebook paper needs to last through an assignment, not through the years. So I don't mind that the surface isn't exactly smooth or that it feels flimsy. And the paper appears to be a standard size, but it's not; instead of being 8 1/2 x 11, it's only 8 x 10 1/2. Sure, that's labelled on the product and listed in the product description, but who thinks to look at the size when you expect notebook paper to be standard?<br /><br />But there's an even greater issue with size for me--the huge margins! The left margin is 1 1/2 inches wide, while the right margin is 1 1/4 inch. That leaves only 5 1/4 inches of writing space. It's a ridiculous amount of wasted space, especially since this is college-ruled paper! At a little over 1 1/2 inches, the top margin just further contributes to wastefulness. I imagine that a student could run through this paper pretty quickly and never even have a clue as to why.",2,,4,209
80,"Paper is paper right? But knowing that the holes line up, that the rules are spaced as you want them and that you can write easily are important.

I've been researching my family tree and admittedly I do press hard on paper with ink or pencil, if I write on top of the stack of notebook paper, then you can see the indentations about four or five sheets in.<br />The thinness also creates issues with any type of marker - bleeds through the back.<br /><br />The paper is good for notetaking.  However, it is smaller than a normal sheet of paper at 10-1/2&#34;x8&#34;.

87,Was looking for a lightweight cutter that wasn't too bulky but could still handle several sheets. I love this cutter. The guidelines are clearly marked and the blade cuts easily. No ripped/bent papers. Easily goes through 10 sheets at a time. Perfect for a small office.,5,,5,260
88,A little disappointed by the flimsiness of the product. I have some concern over the durability. I seems to work fine on 1 or 2 sheets of 20# paper ( all I have right now). I will try on other materials in the next few days and see.,4,,5,60
89,"I use paper cutters primarily for origami, where getting straight and accurate cuts is CRITICAL. Unfortunately it's very hard to get them correct with this trimmer. First, the guides are relatively wide compared to other cutters, so it's hard to know where precisely to line the paper up. The other issue is that the guide in the middle of the cutter is further down on this larger size than on the smaller model. This makes is much more difficult to line paper up if you are cutting to sizes of around 6 inches or less, which I very often am (cutting 12x12 scrapbook paper to 6x6). It doesn't handle multiple sheets particularly well, I could do about 3 or 4 before I started having issues, but it's the accuracy of it that is the biggest issue for me personally. If you don't need perfect cuts though it's a good enough trimmer and certainly will do the trick for photo use and other less critical jobs.",3,,5,378
90,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very, very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses",5,,5,21
91,"In short, I am impressed by how very lightweight this trimmer is.  If you want to be able to pick up your trimmer and easily move it to another room, I highly recommend this.If you want a little more detail...Paper trimmers usually have heavy wooden bases, probably so that they won't slide around during use.  But that extra weight means that you can't easily move the trimmer from room to room if you are working on a project.  By contrast, this Swingline &#34;Lite&#34; trimmer is probably about as light as it could possibly be and still remain functional.  It is very easy to carry around with one hand.<br /><br />The base is a thin but sturdy plastic.  In addition to the four corner supports on the bottom of the base, there is a fifth support in the center of the bottom.  No doubt, this extra support is necessary on such a thin trimmer in order to keep it from sagging in the middle when holding your papers in place.<br /><br />I am also pleased with the accurate cuts.  Some trimmers I've used seem to give me consistently crooked cuts.  Not so with this Swingline.  Whether I cut one or ten pieces of paper, I have never been disappointed by the cutting.<br /><br />If I could gripe about one thing (maybe worth a half-star deduction), it would be this: I find that the safety latch for locking down the arm is a little tricky to access.  It's a bit &#34;tucked away&#34; under the arm itself, making it a little harder to lock and unlock.  However, because it's such a light trimmer, it's easy to pick up the entire trimmer with one hand and tilt it until I find the latch.<br /><br />All in all, this is really a great trimmer.  Don't be put off by the &#34;Lite&#34; in its title.",5,,5,381
92,"By way of disclosure, I received a sample of this product for evaluation purposes.<br /><br />The only guillotine trimmer I ever used with any frequency was my mother's.  It was a heavy unit, made largely of hardwood with a heavy spring-loaded arm.  It was hardly portable -- it weighed a lot.<br /><br />This Swingline trimmer is much lighter, with the surfaces made of plastic.  It's easy to get it out when you have a job that calls for it.<br /><br />It has a sharp blade that cuts paper cleanly without requiring excessive force.  It is reasonably stable on a table.<br /><br />It can deal with sheets of paper bigger than the standard 8.5&#34;x11&#34; size, having a 15&#34; cutting length.  If you need to trim legal paper lengthwise, this trimmer can do it.<br /><br />Overall, it is a fine trimmer and isn't too expensive.  If you only need a trimmer for occasional use, I'd recommend it.",4,,5,201
93,"First of all, the handle is not installed, you need to root around in the box for it.  Takes one second to put on.<br /><br />Just got finished cutting out flashcards from cardstock, 750 of them (so over 300 cut) and 200 sheets of regular paper in half (400 cuts).  Also tried it on photos.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It easily cuts 6 sheets of cardstock (110lb weight) consistently<br /><br /> Raised edge makes it pretty easy to keep stacks of paper straight.<br /><br />It will cut “slivers”  (as small as 2mm wide) off of sturdy paper (photo paper or cardstock).<br /><br />Easy to store , it is pretty lightweight.  With the green handle installed it is 22in (including handle) by 13in by  2.75 deep (the handle part)<br /><br />You can lock the arm in place.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />With regular paper, it has a harder time with slivers, it tends to smoosh the paper a bit.<br /><br />I wish it had labels across the top, not just of inches and cm but where to align for cutting standard sheets in half (for both long and short directions).  I ended up marking these on it with a Sharpie to speed up my project.<br /><br />This is NOT a product for use in a school or if you have to cut hundreds of sheets of paper every day.  It is great for home use.",4,,5,254

95,"When I first got the [[ASIN:B00006IATI Swingline ClassicCut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmer]] a couple years ago, I was pretty happy with it.  I used it mostly for cutting coupons and various craft projects, nothing really over the top.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is not very durable for the long run.  There are also some safety issues with this product.  In use, the unit would lift off the table during cutting.  Considering how razor sharp the blade is, this could lead to a serious problem.  While I appreciate that this product is lightweight and ultra-portable, this seems to be a contributing factor to this problem.  The product also lacks the ability to adjust the edge, thus you may have a harder time getting uniform cuts most of the time. Sometimes the cuts can look uneven and really sloppy.<br /><br />Being made of plastic, the unit has worn over time and I've started to see cracks in the workmanship.  It would have been nicer to see this product made from something more durable like metal.  It doesn't happen to often, but sometimes the unit snags the paper and rips it.  This is mostly in the middle but doesn't happen too often.  For a long term investment, I would not recommend this cutter.",2,,5,23
96,"****<br />I also own a heavy wooden guillotine trimmer that is a really completely different caliber product. This Swingline is much lighter and for me, who uses it only occasionally, perfect. I have had no problems with its operation and everything works great; it also cuts a straight line on several sheets of paper, which is the most I would use. It is a much cheaper-quality product than the heavy wooden trimmer. If I could have just one I would pick the more expensive product as I am sure it will perform better over time as well as last longer. The advantage of this Swingline trimmer is that it is light and portable and can be stored easily in small areas.<br /><br />Another good use for this trimmer would be as a second trimmer, since it is 15 inches long. It is a good price compared to the heavy 15-inch wooden trimmers. If you do a lot of trimming and have the room, you could use a sturdy wooden guillotine trimmer for everyday usage and then this longer lighter one for speciality trimming of longer/wider items.<br /><br />All in all, recommended for light use, but especially as a second trimmer.<br />*****",4,,5,411

98,"I really like this Swingline Trimmer.  It's very easy to use, lightweight and easier to store than the big, heavy ones.  It performs well, can easily cut ten sheets of paper at a time.  I've used it for a lot of paper crafts, cutting heavy cardstock with ease and accuracy.  The paper is easy to line up, so you get satisfying results.  I've had quite a few trimmers, and they never really lived up to my expectations.  I have a very expensive Martha Stewart trimmer which is a huge disappointment, difficult to line up and and the cuts are often slightly off, which drives me crazy.  This trimmer far surpasses that one, for less than half the price.  I'd highly recommend for scrapbookers and other crafters, for students (with parental supervision, of course).  There is a lockable safety latch on the side to prevent accidents while not in use.  Very pleased with this product.",5,,5,281
99,"It's nearly all-plastic (feels cheap but it looks okay from a distance) with the exception of the blade itself which appears to be thin steel and  the bolts that keep it together. The only assembly needed is attaching the handle (just push it in) onto the blade assembly.<br /><br />The trimmer features:<br /><br />- inch and metric rulers<br />- a protective guard rail<br />- a blade latch hook<br />- a largely meaningless 10-year limited warranty (you pay for shipping, does not cover the blade)<br /><br />Putting it to the test, I found that it does cut photo paper well. The cut is straight and the blade cuts through the paper with no difficulty. Because of the guard rail, I doubt that you can squeeze more than a few sheets at a time but that's not a big issue for me because I will be cutting photos only and I doubt that I will ever stack more than 2 or 3 sheets at the most.<br /><br />Inside the box there's a note that says that Swingline is GBC's new name.<br /><br />One (almost) good comment on the seller. Shipping was quick and the item came in perfect condition but the packaging wasn't exactly state of the art.<br />__________________________<br /><br />Six months update:<br /><br />Still cuts well so that self-sharpening claim on the blade may hold some truth. On the other hand, I only cut a couple hundred sheets so I can say it's great for casual use and it COULD be good for heavier cutting activities.",4,,5,409
100,"If you want to cut large pieces of paper straight, this is a great choice for home. It works just like the big heavy-duty paper cutters at the elementary schools. You lift up the arm with the sharp blade, slide the paper where you want it and bring the arm down to cut. It’s got marks to measure any length up to 15 inches and provides a nice, straight cut.<br /><br />For the most part, it works very well for me. I tried to cut eight pages of 22 pound regular copy paper and found that was too much. The middle of the blade got stuck, or wouldn’t easily cut. I found six pages worked better. This unit is light-weight and easy to move around. It works best on a sturdy surface like a table or counter. The only thing I don’t like about it is that it won’t fit in the box when fully assembled. It came with the handle not attached to the cutting arm. It popped on easily, but to store it in the closed box, I would have to remove the handle. I don’t want the handle to get loose over time from being removed and put back on, so I store it with the end of the box open and hope not too much dust gets in.",4,,5,156
101,"I do a variety of crafts including origami. With origami, you have to get the cut exactly perfect and exactly square for the end result to come out properly. I'm often doing shapes for weddings or special occasions where there is an unusual request. I'll need to make large origami cranes from vellum, or watercolored origami lotus flowers, or that sort of thing. So I need a cutter that can do the job. I wouldn't dream of trying to do these by hand with scissors.<br /><br />The guillotine might be fine for cutting coupons, or separating tax forms, or other things where it doesn't have to be precise. But I find that the drawing motion of the blade pulls the paper and, despite my best efforts, won't make an exactly perfect cut. With the rolling cutters, there's no issue at all. It's exactly perfect. Plus it's far easier and safer.<br /><br />This unit is pretty much all lightweight plastic and doesn't feel sturdy. The blade does lock with a safety catch, but I wouldn't want this around kids. It's fairly sharp. So you have a sharp blade but it doesn't make precise cuts.<br /><br />To make things a little worse, their guide lines are fairly fat, so you're not able to make a precise measurement, either.<br /><br />So I'm not sure where I'd recommend this. In just about every situation where I could see someone using this, I could see them using the rotary one instead, and the rotary one would work better. Still, I'll give it three stars for being at least reasonably ok at performing its task.<br /><br />We were sent a review copy by the Amazon vine program.",3,,5,388
102,"This is a plastic Guillotine from Swingline. All that plastic and light weight may make it feel a bit on the cheaper side, especially if you are used to the heavier guillotine. But, this works just as well. It comes with the usual inch and metric ruler and the alignment grid. It has a protective guardrail to protect your precious little fingers.<br /><br />I have used it for about 3 weeks now and it has worked well. It cuts in straight lines and the cut is neat. I really like it and it has replaced my old guillotine (which I gave back to my sister...the original owner).",4,,5,305
103,"I've tried out 3 paper cutters just this year. I use it daily for work, many times a day--I sent out samples of products and for sample labels I just hand cut the labels before sending and also cut out the mailing labels.  That means lots of cutting, and some of it on sticky backed surfaces.  I also use paper cutters in my art.<br /><br />This one, by far, outperformed all the others, even my commercial ones.  It's amazing that it's so lightweight, but cuts so easily, even bigger stacks of paper.<br /><br />Most seem to cut by shaving the blade up close to the metal bar rather than by having a good and sharp blade. This means more resistance and pulling---This one is a light easy pull but fast and accurate cut.  Far better.<br /><br />My other cutters tend to make the paper move, crooked, so precise cuts are not as easy--this one kept the paper just where I place it for straight cuts.<br /><br />Also a few of my others have a large protector so you can't easily see where you are cutting. This has a small bar.  Whereas I wound up removing the protector on some other paper cutters because it was in the way of my site, I can leave this one on, meaning fingers are protected but I can still see.<br /><br />This one is longer than may others so long pieces of paper are no issue<br /><br />And the guides on the cutter make it simple to align items straight, whether vertically or horizontally.<br /><br />Best cutter I've owned in years, for sure.",5,,5,103

They are made of recycled paper and I managed to bend one taking it out of the pack getting help from a cat.  That messed up my nice set a bit, but I was still able to get the labels on, it's just I had a gaping hole in the middle of my otherwise very professional looking notebook.<br /><br />I was really quite happy with the tabs, the template and printing of the tabs, but I felt like these dividers were lacking a bit.

115,"Like most Avery products, these dividers were easy to print with the free template.  I printed these up to help organize a binder we have that stores all of our home brewing recipes.  We were able to label these divider tabs with different beer styles, which will make the recipes easier to find.  For the price these are worth buying, as these are some of the easiest labels to print and apply all at once.",4,,6,318
116,"Avery makes some of the best printable products. These dividers works great. They are compatible with all three,whole rings. These are easy to use. You can personalize your dividers any way you want. From recipes,to homework to bills. These can be used for almost any. Overall great product.",5,,6,115
117,"These are some of the better customizable tabs out there. The software is easy to use and the finish is excellent. The only con I have to these type of custom label tabs is that they tend to be rather shorter than the standard ones. SO they don't stick out as much in the binder. Not really a big deal, they still work great. Just an fyi ..",4,,6,276
118,"These Avery Index Maker White Dividers are a cleverly designed product that makes it easy to create custom labeled tabs. We go through a lot of Avery products in our small business and have almost always been pleased with the results, and this is no exception.<br /><br />The on-line template worked well for my needs but you can also download it for MS Office if needed. The labels can be printed all at once or selectively and applied as needed.<br /><br />Another great Avery product.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",5,,6,307
119,"These were fantastic easy to use labels.  I really like the fact I can just go to Avery's website and print from there.  The labels applied to the dividers easily, and gave my binder a more professional look than handwriting on them.  I really like the look of the printed dividers after applying these.  The price is good and if neatness is your thing, get these.",5,,6,262
120,"The real gem in this set of white dividers is the easy-to-apply clear labels that can be printed at home and then adhered to the tabs in order to produce professionally looking labeled dividers. There are 10 strips of 8 clear labels so that you can make 10 different sets of indexes. Simply go to the Avery Design & Print and find the template by the product number, then customize and print your strip of labels using a laser or inkjet printer. Transferring the strip of labels to the divider tabs is straight forward. Just align the strip on the dividers tabs and press firmly, then peel away the Easy Apply strip in order to leave behind the perfectly aligned labels on the divider tabs. The clear labels are fairly invisible, so you would mostly see the professionally looking print on the dividers themselves.<br /><br />From start to finish, the label making process is fairly simple and easy to achieve without special knowledge of a particular software to produce perfectly lined up labels yourself. All you need to do is to go to the website and it would walk you through the process of designing and printing your labels. Other than that, the dividers themselves are rather ordinary but fully functional, and they are a great value for the money.",5,,6,272
121,"These are sturdy, easy to use, dividers with tabs that you can print to label them.  I love Avery, because their website is full of templates for all of their products.  You can go to their site to choose font designs.  Once you have done so, you can print them for these tabs.<br /><br />What more can I say.  They are great dividers, so if you are looking for some, buy these!",5,,6,54

There's an info sheet included that has Avery's website and their customer service number if you need help.<br /><br />It's pretty easy but may be a little tricky for some. If you get stuck, call Avery and they'll help you out.<br /><br />The labels look great on the dividers. If using it for a presentation or for making info binders for a meeting, they will have you looking like the King or Queen of the Information Binder Kingdom.",5,,6,340
123,"These dividers with labels make it easy for those, like me, that aren't so great at figuring out computer things. Avery even makes it easier by providing a website, with templates. Super simple! I get to have neat, professional looking dividers without much brain power.<br /><br />You can even customize these with company logos or graphics, if you wanted. The labels are easy to apply to the dividers.",4,,6,261
124,"I like the clear labels for printing on to put on dividing tabs.  It looks a little confusing with the blue parts on it but in the end it is going to be clear.  This is a very simple process.<br /><br />I was really pleased to be able to use the Avery with Microsoft word. It was really easy—once I knew what to look for.  It was not an area I had looked for before and so obviously, I didn’t find it.  This makes it even easier to print labels for things that are going to be repetitive tasks.<br /><br />I have never gotten the hang of putting five labels at a time.  If I had to do more often in my home office, I would probably learn it as quickly as I could.  As it is, it remains an unnecessary skill set.",4,,6,273
125,"I really like these.  The price is right, and the tabs are sturdy.  The hole punched area is reinforced, so they shouldn't pull loose easily.  The downside:  The card stock of the actual divider is not really as thick as some others.  For light use occasionally accessed information, these would be great.  If I needed dividers for heavy use, I would try something else.",4,,7,279
126,"The Wilson Jones insertable tab dividers work to separate pages but they are definitely not of the highest quality. For occasional use only, I would recommend these. For daily use, I do not believe they will hold up. The tabs are assorted colors which are on the pale site and I find this attractive. Unfortunately, they do not line up evenly and that is bothersome. The dividers are simply okay, nothing more.",3,,7,406
127,"The Wilson Jones tabs are durable, sturdy and for non-generics well priced.  I found them to be adequate for reference use, and only time will tell how they ultimately hold up but they appear to be well made.",4,,7,285

129,"These are your average tabs, except that they come in a package of 8.  Usually tabs come in 5 but having this come in 8 is very convenient.  They're a little thin so I don't expect them to last a long time with regular 'abuse'.  I like that they are all different colors and putting the paper in the tabs isn't very difficult.  Cost?  At the time of this writing...reasonable.  Recommended.",4,,7,289
130,"This is a pretty standard product category. It's a binder divider set and each has a little colored tab where you can slide in a label. It's nice for keeping classwork or other papers organized. Since it's not really something where there's a ton of room for innovation, it's not like there's any huge feature that says &#34;yes, get this one!&#34; but the quality is good at least. They used a reasonably solid paper material with a little bit of reinforcement around the area where the holes are for the binder. The colors on the little tabs look nice, and they have the strip of labels you'll need right in the package. It's nothing incredibly fancy, but they did the job well.",4,,7,302
131,"Two kids, homeschooled in 8 topics makes for a lot of papers that you end up keeping for a while.  Each child gets a set so that we can keep papers separated by subject.  It serves the purpose.  Papers are filed daily and kept for review records by state or school district officials.",4,,7,296

133,Well these are just your ordinary yellow dividers with multi color tabs that you see in stores often. Nothing too special or unique about them. This is a pack of 8 with white tabs... the dividers are not thick or durable and will indeed tear out rip over time.,3,,7,43
134,"I like that this set has eight tabs.  My previous dividers came only in sets of five, and that's just not enough for my purposes.  My only issue with these is that they do get pretty ratty looking with hard use, but I just think of it as Shabby Chic.",4,,7,352
135,"This are your standard tab dividers, the lightweight paper with minimal reinforcement at the edges.  They are pretty much standard and should hold up for a semester or two, but are not meant for long term usage.  If you want something more permanent (and pricey) you may wish to consider the [[ASIN:B00006ICF7 Wilson Jones View-Tab Transparent Dividers]].<br /><br />I do like the fact that there are eight layered dividers as opposed to the standard five or six.  These aren't on card stock, but rather heavy paper.  For example, if I wanted I could fold and crease the entire package.  They are decent, but not great.  One plus is that they are now an Amazon Add-on, a real plus in my book.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />►  Classic style, insertable dividers are made of durable paper with plastic tabs<br />►  Double reinforced binding edge and reinforced tabs make these dividers long-lasting and durable<br />►  Blan Size, Blue]]",3,,7,301
136,These are sturdy tab dividers.  The edge that goes into a binder has some sort of plastic on one side that prevents tearing. The paper is good quality.<br /><br />The tabs on the edges of the dividers are about an inch and a half long and half an inch high.  Paper to put in the tabs also come with this.  As a result it is possible to write something that is readable on the tabs.<br /><br />There are fine tab dividers.,4,,7,375
137,"Face it, you are reading a review on tab dividers. I wish I could make this a fantastic piece of literature but that isn't going to happen. These tabs are exactly what they say they are. They are paper dividers with tabs and they work well for what they are. That being said, I really feel like they could have upped the thickness of the dividers themselves to they held up a little better. I don't foresee these lasting a long time in a binder you reference regularly because of how thin the material is. For an occasional use these are definitely good.",3,,7,86
138,"These look nice-- the colored tabs are bright and nicely transparent-- but the cardstock is thin and it seems like they're going to need reinforcements quickly. I guess they'd be fine if you're just going to use them on occasion, but if these are going into a binder that you'll flip through often, you can do better.",3,,7,338
139,"These are the dividers I use in my kids workbook binders (homeschool). They are cheap, simple and easy to use.These dividers were great. The tabs are nice and sturdy (even for clumsy hands). They reach past the lined paper so I can easily see the sections.<br /><br />They are handy and a heck of a deal.",4,,7,61
140,"With homeschooling, I seem to be adding more and more folders and dividers into our days. We've ended up with a great deal of the Wilson Jones products, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />These seem to be just like what I used when in school.<br /><br />While there's nothing extra special to point out about these tabs(they're pretty standard), again, I have no complaints.",4,,7,261

Any higher and you may as well get a higher quality set)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Papers can slip out easily (tape edges to secure, but then it's more permanent)<br />Not the most solid construction but as long as it doesn't see super heavy use it should be fine",5,,7,36
142,"I always prefer these dividers.  They are simple and easy to use, with the ability to write a subject and insert it into the tabs.  The tabs are well spaced and there are 8, and they look very neat in a notebook.  They have 3 holes and fit into any standard ring binder.<br />The different colors and perfectly spaced tabs make it very easy to organize a notebook and flip to exactly what you need. Over time I find that i become as used to the colors and position as I do the letters.<br />The ring edge does have a plastic coat to reinforce it a bit and keep it from tearing.",5,,7,194
143,"These insertable tab dividers match up easily against the standard dividers that students have been using forever. The big difference is that standard dividers usually come in a five or six pack, whereas these come in an 8 pack. For students, this allows a tab for every class as well as a couple of extra sections for students to personalize to their own organizational style.<br /><br />Like other standard dividers, the paper used to make these is slightly denser than regular notebook paper, but still rather flimsy. There is a reinforcement strip at the hole-punched edge, but it is still rather flimsy. These dividers would work fine for a semester's use, but I wouldn't expect them to hold up under heavy usage for a full year.",3,,7,209
144,"These transparent dividers are a perfect addition for those big binders students need for college classes.  Loose-leaf hand-outs and other flyers are easily protected and easily accessible this way.  The plastic makes these harder to rip from the holes, too.  The colored tabs make these easier to divide by topic.<br /><br />The size is a standard binder size, so these dividers don't stick out from the rest of the binder and create a bulky appearance.",5,,8,190
145,"For school, work, or personal organizing, these dividers make for a clear (pun intended) and concise presentation.<br />Sturdy yet flexible dividers make the contents of any binder easy to navigate.<br />The company even supplies a header template via their website, printable in Word and WordPerfect, as well as detailed instructions on how to do it without the template.<br />For those of us weary over stuffing tabs into tiny slots, this clear-view format is easier and, in my opinion, has a cleaner, more streamlined look.",5,,8,90
146,"This is one of the products that makes you wonder why someone didn't come up with it sooner. The sheer ease of use makes these tabs wonderful. No more typing/printing/writing on little labels or inserts. You just print out the sheet of paper and slide it into the sleeve to have perfectly lined up and easily visible labels.<br /><br />The two main options for using these tabbed dividers is either heading over to the wilsonjones website and creating your cover page and title page online or downloading the Word document and creating it on your computer. The online program has some options for professional, home, teacher, and student use. If you register, you get access to more options as well as the capability to store your designs for future use. Whether you go with the online option or the downloaded computer option, it's as easy as plugging in your information and printing. You can add graphics if you want to jazz it up.<br /><br />The cover page (table of contents) is covered by a clear poly cover sheet. The tabs are made of a durable see-through poly material. The title page gets placed in a sleeve that allows the tab titles to be seen at all times. It's a great idea that really works.",5,,8,105
147,"These colorful plastic dividers banish the tedium of inserts. Just go to the Wilson Jones website and download the free template. You place the sheet with the printed information behind the last divider page and you can easily see the sections through the transparent tabs. The dividers themselves are sturdy and the colors are appealing. They seem to be durable and the clever system makes organization easy. These are great for school, home or office. Recommended.",4,,8,191
148,The price is a little high but the dividers are strong and firm and should last for a long time. Love the different colors to find things easy when you open your binders. I am redoing my office and these fit the bill perfectly. Wish I had some more of them for the many binders that I am redoing but am happy to be using such a quality product in my office.<br /><br />Would recommend!,5,,8,79
149,"I don't know why I haven't seen this before.  (Maybe I did, but it didn't register) This is a clever twist on the divider concept, in that instead of fiddling around with printing out labels you then have to past on divider tabs, or worse... insert inside divider tabs, you instead label a sturdy sheet of paper which you then put behind the translucent tabs.<br /><br />This means that all the labels are always showing --because the index sheet is in the back -- and you can easily reuse the dividers by switching out the one sheet in the back.<br /><br />What I LOVE<br />--8 tabs on sturdy plastic dividers.<br />--the tabs are attractively curved<br />--there are 5 sets in this bundle and each set has a plastic clamp which keeps the sets together neatly.  [I think we've all worked in offices where when you go to the supply cabinet all you can find are 7 of the 8 tabs, and three of those are the same color. arrgh)<br /><br />QUIBBLE<br />--online template use takes some fiddling<br /><br />I love this idea. I love that the dividers are grouped together, and I think having the one sheet at the back is an easier alternative to seeing my messy writing on the type of tabs you can write on, or the types of tabs you either have to type out or print out and insert or stick.",5,,8,246
150,"I wasn't sure I'd like these at first. They seemed a bit thin and bendy. But I put together a portfolio of my photography and used these to separate out the different types of photography (landscapes, flowers, that sort of thing). They looked great! They let you see into the next section to see what was coming, but the color gave it a nice visual indicator. All in all they were both pretty and functional.<br /><br />Well recommended.",5,,8,388
151,"I am pleased to finally find such a functional set of dividers. The View-Tab Transparent Dividers are made of brightly colored, transparent plastic that are sturdy, and at the same time fantastic looking. They are professional enough for the office and perfect for home or school.<br /><br />I have the 8-tab set which comes in a reasonably priced pack of five sets of dividers. Because these dividers do not need stick-on labels, they can be used over and over again simply by creating a new index template which lies below the see through tabs. No more typing or writing on little bits of paper and stuffing them into plastic tabs.<br /><br />I used the first set of dividers in one of my 2-inch financial binders. They are easy to flip and the plastic has a solid, durable feel to it. These are not going to rip or tear like the paper dividers. To create the template for the tabs, I used the online software. I found it to be a little clunky, but it does a satisfactory job. It took me a few attempts to get the tabs positioned just right with fonts I liked. I used one of the generic themes, but it also allows uploading of images. Formatting with Word is also an option, and templates can be downloaded.",5,,8,354
152,"These are the best designed and sturdiest  dividers I have seen. The cost also reflects this quality.  I would LOVE for Wilson Jones to make these with pockets in them, then they would be absolute pure perfection.<br /><br />Thick plastic, these should stand up to the abuse doled out by my family members.<br /><br />I had no problem with the template,  and I LOVE that they do not make you create an account in order to download them.  If you want to preview them just google “Wilson Jones templates” and follow the link, you can test out how easy they are before you buy.",5,,8,254

This includes 5-complete sets that can be printed using the template referenced in the instructions.<br /><br />The plastic tabs are both good looking and very durable, making them perfect for either school or business use.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",5,,8,307
154,"These tab dividers are excellent. First off, it's a bargain. You get 5 sets of 8 dividers. The dividers are well made and seem durable. So, the idea behind these is that, instead of writing headers into tiny little pieces, you print off a main section header (template found in Wilson Jones Website) and then you put that page in a clear protective sleeves (included, for each set). If you have a well organized binder, this should work well. I like how this system works. I make up a lot of binder notebooks (one per case) and I am always annoyed every time I have to find little labels and then cut them and then make them fit into the little slots (!!!). With this, I only print one page and presto! No scissors, no folding over post it notes to make it fit, no aggravation. These work great.",5,,8,305
155,"I've been buying dividers for years for projects, kids, and committee binders. I usually buy the thin, plastic ones with the slip in tab. If you are still considering those, you need to change your mind and get these. They are super thick, super durable, and a great design.<br /><br />The tabs don't get written on, you put your tab titles on a sheet (templates provided) that sits in pocket in the back. So because the tabs are super clear, you read through the tab to the sheet. This makes it really easy to make a change without writing out a new tab filler or writing on and erasing each tab.<br /><br />This is a great system and to get 5 packs at this price is a bargain.",5,,8,361
156,"Great thinking outside the box.  Now you don't have to write on each tab, cut and insert them one by one.  All you need in a single page that shows all the tabs.  The template (chose View-Tab Dividers 8-Tab Landscape) available online is very easy to create.<br /><br />This is a lot of dividers, 5 sets with 8 dividers each.  The pages are color coded and super strong.",5,,8,265
157,"These are so much thicker and more durable than the usual brands you find.  If you go onto the Wilson Jones website, you can get a template for ease of use, too.  It's really handy to purchase one box and have several sets of dividers there.  The colors are bright, and nicer than the normal ones.  You can remove labels and reuse, which is also a plus.  My new go to dividers.",5,,8,279
158,"These are kinda pretty, and definitely high quality. The dividers are thick and the colors are attractive, and moving the tab names to a separate sheet of paper at the back that you can see through the tabs makes it easy to see what things are, while also creating a cleaner look overall (and a much less fussy and difficult result) vs the tiny tabs you have to slip into dividers to label them.<br /><br />These are actually solid enough and nice enough that I'm thinking of using one of the sets with some paper behind it basically like they were white boards, so I can quickly scribble some totally erasable notes (like quickly trying out a rough version of some math) before I go onto actual paper and start writing a clear and final version. I could easily see someone putting checklists behind them too, so you can check things off with a dry erase market and then wipe it clean at the next meeting or the next day when it's time to start over.<br /><br />The basic paper dividers that usually come in binders get the job done all right for many purposes, but if I were going to deliberately choose something I'd be looking for these. They're easier to use, I think they're likely to hold up longer, and they certainly look better.",5,,8,302
159,"Wilson Jones hit it out of the ballpark with the View-Tab Transparent Dividers.  Sold in a package of 5 sets of 8-Tabbed dividers, it's a breeze to assemble what you need quickly.  Just use the online template to create a sheet of your tab names and print it, thereby allowing you to view each tab from the rear sheet without actually writing, printing or sticking adhesive labels on the physical dividers.  For me, the only weakness is that unless a reversed page is created for the front of the binder, the identification of the tab requires an additional step to figure out.  The curve of each tab is more comfortable for me than angular tabs and I really love being able to also have a clear view at the first page beneath each divider.  This opens the door to creativity in designing the pages.  I'm certain these will hold up well and am also impressed at the affordability when these are purchased in a package of 5.  I also really like the colors.",5,,8,406
160,Sturdy and professional looking these dividers fit the bill for a gamut of uses. They are far nicer than any I have ever used before (but their price tag also reflects that) I would recommend them for business or home usage and also for school during the older years. The colors are crisp and the pages feel like they will last for years of use. I personally am not highly keen on the template that lines up with the tabs which took me away from giving them a 5 star rating.,4,,8,226
161,"I really like the high quality of these view tabs with transparent dividers.  For a lot of my work, I will want to be dividing it up into logical sections.  The small school-type tabs that have simple paper inserts are way not what I had in mind.  The Wilson Jones version of tabs are perfect for what I need.<br /><br />One thing I like about them, apart and aside from the durability factor, is that if I want I can continually change the title pages and tabs when the need arises.  There are five sets in this box, plenty for the workplace setting and more than enough for my research purposes.<br /><br />I’ve checked out the templates that are offered and the options are more than enough to suit most needs.  You can work in landscape or portrait mode.  You can download templates into Word or you can customize and print them out.  I liked the assortment of templates, from fun ones to professional.<br /><br />I love the colors, which are slightly different from the standard ones around.  They are just eye-catching enough for personal use, but not overly done and can be used professionally for presentations.

162,I was very happy with this composition book. This is the classic book used by students in so many classes. I was very happy with the thickness of the paper. A lot of the products today come with very  thin paper but this paper seemed thicker. The cover was thick  and durable. It had some useful info in the covers. I would recommend this product.,5,,9,167
163,"This is a fairly nice composition book, with two-hundred pages on which to write. Each page provides about twenty-five lines. Printed at the front is a chart  for creating schedule notes. Additionally, the back page features a twelve-column and twelve-row multiplication table, a handy conversion chart, and grammar rules for the modern illiterate.",4,,9,322
164,"The Mead Composition Book is the classic black marbled composition book that students use from elementary school on up. Unfortunately, the one that I received already had a couple of issues that make me question the day-to-day durability of the current version. The black tape binding is already starting to peal a little and the front and back cover have wrinkles in them.<br /><br />It's not too much of a deterrent for me because I like to use these basic composition books and jazz them up a bit for my daughter. I use scrapbook paper and customize them for her current favorite colors/themes. Each notebook can easily be customized for the different subjects. I've even made her a pretty journal for recording life events.<br /><br />The pages are the typical weight of lined paper these days. It would be nice if the pages were a little heavier as the writing on one side tends to show on the other side, but it's not a huge deal.<br /><br />I do want to point out that it's a good idea to shop around for these as the prices can vary greatly, and I feel that over $5 for a basic composition book is definitely too much.",3,,9,105
165,"4.5 stars, actually. I received the wide ruled notebook. It's a classic composition notebook with sewn binding. The paper feels good, though it is a bit smoother than I like. I prefer paper with just a tad more bite, personally. It has a place to write a schedule on the inside front cover and information on the inside back cover, such as a multiplication table and metric conversion chart. What I don't like, and the reason I took a half star off, is the cover is really glossy inside and out. It makes it difficult to write on with anything other than a permanent marker. It's not a huge deal. The notebook in general is good and is just as good as the ones I remember from when I was in school *ahem* years ago.",4,,9,218

A scheduler is located  on the inside front cover and the inside back cover features basic academic information, i.e.., metric conversions, multiplication tables, parts of speech. It may not be sexy but it is durable and functional. Shop around because you usually can find these at a significantly lower price. This is a basic, old school standard that does its job, plain and simple. You can find flashier but none more functional.",4,,9,191
169,"The Mead Composition book in Wide Ruled format is a good value. It has 100 sheets for actual 200 pages of writing. My writing is rather large, so the wide ruled format works well for me. Some teachers prefer college ruled, so be sure to find how which is needed for a class. I like the book binding (sewn in) as opposed to glued to the edge. It makes for a sturdy book that can hold up to some abuse.<br /><br />I use these types of notebooks for a myriad of uses - story ideas, working through recipes (what went right, what went wrong, etc.) I don't use them for throw away notes because I can use post its for those. This is meant for information you want to keep in one spot.<br /><br />I'll certainly buy more of this product in the future.",5,,9,259
170,"My daughter has used these in the past. Although they lasted the entire school year or her, the covers were well worn by the end of the season.<br /><br />This composition book contains 100 sheets of paper that can be used on each side which amounts to 200 pages you can write on. The pages are bound into the book & are not meant to be removed. Each sheet of paper is a tad thicker than what is found in most loose leaf paper packages. The cover is stiff cardboard that can take some abuse. By the end of the school year, it will definitely look like it's been used.  Wide ruled paper is commonly used by elementary grade students.<br /><br />Of course a composition book like this can be used for other purposes...diary, record keeping, notes, etc.<br /><br />A class schedule chart is printed on inside cover so you can fill in your schedule to see at a glance; multiplication table, conversion table and grammar rules are printed on the inside back cover.<br />The composition book measures 9.75 x 7.50 x .44 inches overall.<br /><br />You might want to check local prices before purchasing this online.",4,,9,368
171,"This is your basic composition book.  There isn't anything wrong with it but I debated 4 stars vs 3 stars because of the price alone online.  If you are going to buy these, buy the 12 pack at least because you get more for your money.  Buying one at over $5 is a rip off in my opinion since you can go into any store locally and buy them at a dollar each or even less sometimes.<br /><br />But pricing aside...  The cover is kind of a plastic-y cardboard material.  Fairly durable.  More-so than your typical spiral notebook cover.  Binding seems so-so.  I think it will hold up.<br /><br />Paper seems a little thin but I think it's on par with how all paper is these days.  I think a lot of companies are thinning out their paper just as so many companies are putting less product in their packages etc... it's just the nature of the economy I guess.",4,,9,374
172,Very nice composition book. I am using it to keep my bookkeeping numbers in(no I don't put everything in my computer-some things I like to do it the old fashioned way).  Perfect color and size to fit all of my needs.<br /><br />Would buy in the future.,4,,9,79
173,"Perhaps we are in the last leg of these notebooks. With all tablets and smartphones are these a dying breed. Hope not. These are high quality and my daughter loves them. Fantastic deal while you get them. Papers are hard, works great with both fountain pens, ballpoint pens and pencils.",5,,9,230
174,"Whether as a student, teacher or writer, composition books have served me well through the years. I looked forward to filling each and every one full of ideas, notes, drawings, doodles and even compositions. Memories of the looks on elementary school students's faces when they received their first BIG KID composition book were priceless acknowledgements of this (w)rite of passage.  Those kids could rough them up, the dogs could gnaw and the composition books survived worn and tattered. Just as those days are long gone, so is the quality Mead gave to them. Ranging from the binding tape to the paper and the sturdy cardboard protective covering, the quality is just OK compared to the stellar quality from yesteryear.<br /><br />Composition books were made to be used, stored for years and referred to years later. Don't hold your breath expecting that from these. Built-in obsolescence now resides within these noble Black Marble covers...heavy sigh. One must move on to find another brand to give one back the joy of actually writing. Excuse me while I refill the inkwell for my quill pen and ponder my next move.",3,,9,42
175,"I purchased the [[ASIN:B00D3T4OHK Mead Black Marble Composition Notebook, Wide Ruled, 100 Sheets, 9.75 x 7.5 Inch Sheet Size, 5 Pack (72368)]] for $6.50 from Amazon for Back-to-School this year.  The 5-pack was a great price at under $7 (even better than WalMart/Target locally).  My son has used these composition books for 3 years now.  They have always held up to a full year of use.  Will continue to buy these.",5,,9,355
176,"Some of the other reviews noted defects or problems with their notebooks so I thumbed through mine to check for the issues (pages sticking together, damaged, or dirty/worn). My notebook arrived in perfect condition. I'm wondering if there is a higher chance of damage based on who sends it to you or where you buy your notebook. I can only say that mine had clean pages that moved freely. The paper is fine. It's not high quality bond, but this is a notebook which is likely to be used for school notes and later thrown away. If you want something for more permanent writing, a (more expensive) journal book would be a better choice.<br /><br />The notebook is relatively standard except for a few features. The cover is plastic and fairly tough. The &#34;Five Star&#34; brand's advertising shows a goat and a dog fighting by gripping opposite sides with their teeth so the notebooks are designed to be tougher than usual cardboard covered ones. It also has a pocket with a reinforced (laminated) upper edge in the front. I'd prefer the pocket were in the back so it didn't have to be move each time one opens the notebook (and so pages in the pockets didn't weight down the cover/front). There is also the varying colors problem that some others have mentioned. I got a nice light blue one, but others have gotten hot pink and you can't choose the color. This is a small point, but you may want to consider that you may get a color that you hate.<br /><br />The binding is better than cheap ones in that the top and bottom have little closed loops to stop the metal spiral from working its way out. Cheaper binders often have inadequate loops or just a bend that doesn't hold. I think you'd need pliers to undo this one. The main issue with this is that the Amazon price is somewhat (about 35%) higher than several other outlets. The price at the time of this review is $3.31, but OfficeMax online is offering the exact same binder for $2.59.",4,,10,364
177,"In my opinion, Five Star makes the highest quality, yet still affordable, notebook. The plastic cover is incredibly durable and can withstand a lot of abuse. I find that the spiral spine does bend over time, but it still lasts a while (and a lot longer than some cheaper brands). I like the pockets for holding loose papers on the inside, and the college-ruled paper is less flimsy than other notebooks. There are cheaper products out there, but if you are looking for a notebook that will last, Five Star has you covered.",5,,10,104
178,"I've been carrying this notebook around in my tote bag for over a month, and it still looks brand new.  The polyethylene cover is very durable, and the spiral hasn't bent even though I carry a lot of other items in the bag.  I especially like the reinforced storage pockets for storing random papers, receipts, etc.",5,,10,343
179,"I have been using Mead and Five star binders for so many years I cant remember when I started buying them. Nice ruled paper has a couple of pockets for pens, paper clips, etc...It has a nice solid feel to it when you are caring it.<br /><br />Will be buying in the future!",4,,10,79
180,"I just gave Mead some grief in a zipper binder over declining quality, but won’t be doing that here.<br /><br />The 5 star notebook is still the workhorse I favored for my own use in college.  My kids get a lot of the twenty cent cheapie notebooks that the office and department stores tout going into the school year, but those notebooks have thin paper covers and wire spiral binding that starts to unravel early on.<br /><br />By comparison, Mead Five Star is the “serious” notebook, whether for college or just as a recognition of your middle schooler/high schooler’s work ethic.  Front cover is plastic, back very thick cardboard, and the spiral binding is noticeably tough – coated vs. wirey.  It even has one high quality cardboard pocket inside the front cover for loose papers, and the top edge of that pocket is reinforced with plastic.<br /><br />Good on Mead for keeping up the quality with their flagship product.  Now about those zipper binders…",5,,10,415
181,"Really like this spiral notebook.  The cover is a kind of plastic, making it sturdier and more long lasting than the ones with paper covers.  There are nice quality folders inside for tucking in loose pieces of paper.  100 sheets.  Great for school or home use. I'd definitely buy more and recommend to students.",5,,10,281
182,"As noted by a variety of reviewers, when you order this notebook, please know that you will receive a color at random. We ended up with bright white. And, yes, you could end up with a pink one (which, understandably, will not be acceptable for those who require this for a more professional environment).<br /><br />These are just like you remember, so that means to be super careful with the metal spiral. Start playing with that and expect pulls in your clothing and backpack. (I had professors who did not allow these for that reason ... we had to buy marble composition books instead).<br /><br />The pockets are nice ... but as we all know, the do tear pretty quickly.",3,,10,357
183,"While this product is very sturdy and contains an inside pocket for loose paper, I find it hard to believe that the original price is nearly $7.00 each.  I would purchase this again IF I was going to use it for classes or to carry from home to other places but it is definitely &#34;overpriced&#34; for what I purchased five of them for, just to make shopping lists and other uses in my home.",3,,10,208
184,"This is a nice spiral notebook. The covers are moisture resistant and what I really like is that the college ruled paper has a perforated line so that when kids want to pull the sheets out, they don't have that ripped/shredded edge that other spiral notebooks give you that don't have this feature.<br /><br />The paper also comes with 3-holes for slipping into notebooks. And the bright blue color that I received was cheerful and pleasant.<br /><br />Shop for the best price.",4,,10,246
185,"Indeed, the Mead Five Star Spiral Notebook is built much better than the spiral notebooks I used in high school and college.  It is built to last.  What I noticed foremost is that the spiral wire won't unravel at the ends because the wire has been tied or locked.  With all my old notebooks, the spiral wire always began to unwind at the ends and its sharp edges would either cut my skin or snag on my clothing.  This was very annoying, and painful.<br /><br />  Next, I noticed that the notebook's two pockets are reinforced to prevent tearing.  In my school days, the thin pockets always tore after a few months.  With the new notebook, transparent tape has been added at the top edges of each pocket to delay this from happening.  Also, I noticed that the front cover has a special slick coating that has been added to make it waterproof.  Furthermore, the back cover appears to be constructed of a much thicker cardboard than what my old notebooks had.<br /><br />  I highly recommend these notebooks for students.  I wish my notebooks had been more like these when I was going to school.  My Hallmark club, the Gift Bearers Collectors Club, buys school supplies for needy children.  I will make sure that notebooks such as the Mead Five Star Spiral Notebook are added to our list of essential items.  The notebooks come in a variety of beautiful colors that are appropriate for children of both genders and all ages.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos",5,,10,228
186,Sturdy and well made notebook is holding up nicely so far.  The cover is durable and still looks great after a month of daily use and carrying in my backpack.  The storage pockets inside the notebook are a plus and the pages tear out easily and cleanly.  I highly recommend this notebook.,5,,10,48
187,"The basics:<br /><br />Cover: Thick, bendable plastic(seems sturdy)<br /><br />Paper: College ruled, one subject, 100 sheets, &#34;easy tear line&#34;<br /><br />Back: Thick Cardboard<br /><br />Extras: Comes with a &#34;pocket page&#34; in the front that has a pocket on each side",4,,10,261
188,"I've liked Five Star products for a few years now because they seem to be of a little better quality than other notebooks. This one is quite sturdy, with thick plastic on the front and a much thicker cardboard backing than I've found in other brands. The pockets in the front are reinforced along the top edge, so they're less likely to tear at the corners. The only reason I can't give this five stars is because the paper seems a lot thinner and more flimsy than the paper I remember from older Five Star notebooks. Still, the paper is better than in other currently available notebooks, and the perforations are stronger, so pages are not as likely to tear out when you don't want them to.",4,,10,198
189,This is a nice looking notebook. It is a step above other notebooks in that it has a spot for you to be able to put loose papers in into an internal folder. It's almost like a folder/notebook combination. This is very useful for something who mainly just needs a notebook but then wants a place to put a few papers. Great for class. It felt very sturdy. comes in a lot of colors. I would recommend it.,5,,10,167
